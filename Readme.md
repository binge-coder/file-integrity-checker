I made this project like 5 years ago. I wanted to be able to check the integrity of linux isos, virtual box, etc that I downloaded from the internet. This still comes in handy sometimes.

- you have a file (binary, txt, iso, etc...) whose hash this python script can find. the python script also helps in comparing the computed hash with the hash you have on you.
